Changes to board
 1.) FET for polarity protection
 2.) battery light - turns off when battery voltage drops below 5.5v
 3.) confirm whether .1 cap used instead of 0.01
 4.) Decide whether to use 330 Ohm network resistor. My sense is to exclude this
 5.) Change 100k potentiometer to ?
 6.) Add square wave generator output

 1.) You mentioned a .1 cap was used instead of a 0.01. My own board appears correct, and the cap is labelled 0.01 on the board (the 0.1 caps are for decoupling only).
 2.) My design uses a 330 ohm network resistor for the digital inputs (far right side on image). In reality this is not needed - the input lines are pulled up to 3.3v with an internal 20k resistor, and so a mechanical switch that shorts the input with ground will work fine, as will any electrical input. The only reason I put the 330 ohm resistor in original was so I could also use this as an output (e.g. attach LEDs) for diagnostic software. My sense is to remove this component. Do you agree?
 3.) Any other changes you suggest?
 4.) I still like the idea of a voltage protection diode. The 9-volt battery style adapters are easy to source, but it is easy to accidentally touch the battery pins with reverse polarity. I take you point about a 6v battery not providing much
